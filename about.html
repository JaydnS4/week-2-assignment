    <h3>First collection</h3>
    <nav>
        <p id="bordered-text">Before I forget, let me tell you about the first collection that is currently in the works.
         Based off a combination of exotic and phenominal looking flowers,
          combined with elements of space ranging from planets
          (which you saw from the work in progress on the home page), nebulae, 
          galaxies and more will come the first collection. 
          Starting off with a total of 6 stickers to wrap up the first collection.</p>
